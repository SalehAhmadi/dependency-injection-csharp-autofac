- Solid understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- Familiarity with using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio

## Topics Included
- Core Principles of Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control
  - Exploring the purposes and benefits of DI and IoC, and how they improve software design.
- Understanding Components and Services
  - Clarifying the terminology used by the Autofac container, particularly the difference between components and services.
- Methods for Component Registration
  - Demonstrating various techniques for registering components, including assembly scanning and module-based registration.
- Managing Component Scope and Lifecycle
  - Strategies for controlling the scope and lifetime of components to ensure efficient resource management and application stability.
- Configuring the Autofac Container
  - Detailed guidance on configuring the Autofac container using different methods, such as XML, JSON, and custom modules.
- Advanced Dependency Injection Techniques
  - In-depth exploration of advanced DI concepts and practices for experienced developers seeking to deepen their knowledge.

## Target Audience
This repository is tailored for:

- Both beginner and experienced .NET/C# developers
- Anyone keen on learning modern approaches to Dependency Injection

## Usage
Since all examples are consolidated in this repository and the files are in .txt format, you can easily convert them back to the original .cs files by simply removing the .txt extension. This allows you to run and modify the code directly in your preferred C# development environment. To make the most of the materials in this repository, ensure you meet the outlined requirements. The content is designed to be exhaustive, providing both fundamental knowledge and advanced insights into Dependency Injection with Autofac.
